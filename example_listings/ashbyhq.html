    <title>Fullstack Software Engineer, Self Serve @ Vanta</title><meta name="title" content="Fullstack Software Engineer, Self Serve @ Vanta" />

  <meta name="description" content="At Vanta, our mission is to help businesses earn and prove trust. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it. 

Our Software Engineers deliver high-value products for our customers, and infrastructure that enables our business to scale.

Vanta’s team and technology surface are growing quickly, and it’s essential that we invest in the right abstractions and systems to enable us to scale with our business. As a Software Engineer, you’ll be responsible for setting technical direction to enable our product and infrastructure to scale with our business, and driving complex projects across our technical stack.. Your past experience will be leveraged to enable and accelerate Vanta’s growth.

Our business has found incredible product-market fit and has monetized effectively since the day we signed our first customer. We’re growing at a blistering pace, which presents career-defining opportunities for engineers to accelerate their growth and to contribute to a rapidly-scaling company.

As a Software Engineer on the Self-Serve Team, you&#39;ll be part of the Platform organization at Vanta, working horizontally across many areas of the product. You&#39;ll help drive customer activation, engagement, and retention by building features and tools that make it easy for users to adopt the product, realize value quickly, and develop habits that support their compliance and security goals. Your work will deliver direct customer value while also contributing to the platform by building reusable patterns and primitives that other teams at Vanta can adopt to drive activation in their respective areas.

Additionally, you&#39;ll play a key role in unlocking new business opportunities for Vanta. You’ll help build out patterns that support product trials, enabling customers to try before they buy and empowering partner teams to create effective trial experiences. Finally, you&#39;ll contribute to in-app purchasing and integration efforts—both for Vanta’s own products and for third-party offerings—so customers can manage all their compliance needs in one place.

At Vanta, we are committed to hiring diverse talent of different backgrounds and as such, it is important to us to provide an inclusive work environment for all. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, veteran or disability status, or any other protected class.

About Vanta

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security. From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world&#39;s leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged. 

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that&#39;s real-time and transparent." />
